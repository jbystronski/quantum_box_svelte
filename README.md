      Virtualiztion library that helps to quickly render chunks of data from unlimited datasets one at a time. Currently it supports visualizing data in form of a list, grid and tree (a nested list). Can be fed with new data continuously, as such it is a good choice for an infinite scrolling type ui. Check also the <a href="https://github.com/jbystronski/quantum_box_react">React version</a>.
